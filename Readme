For linear regression I have downloaded the Real estate valuation dataset from UCI Repository, you can download the dataset from here.
 This dataset contains attributes of house age, distance from nearest MRT Station, no. of convenience store around, and geographical coordinates like longitude and latitude. 
 This attribute dataset has another attribute called house price of the unit area which is act as output.
